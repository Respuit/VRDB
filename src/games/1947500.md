          This one is the very same as the first one: requires you to go to Steam Input, select an appropriate community input map, and even set a different configuration option, ONLY THEN it will work. It works via Steam Link and ALVR, but not WiVRn.
          You can see how to make it work on ALVR/Steam Link on the start of this gameplay: https://youtu.be/TDw_C7Q3V9o
          Versions:
