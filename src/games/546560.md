          Works well on OC, but the A and X buttons cause you to snap turn right and left respectively, and i'm not sure if you can change that
          game does not function well on xrizer, hands are horribly offset and thumbsticks do nothing

          Works 100% fine IF you use the following OpenComposite git branch : https://gitlab.com/OrionMoonclaw/OpenOVR/-/tree/priorities to fix the A and X buttons (use Envision to easily switch branch)
          Xrizer currently has issues with hands

          Has the occasional issues between the native Linux version and Proton ran one detecting the headset or SteamVR process, but that might be a bit out of this report. The game doesn't run at all with Monado however, sadly. Crash with asking a SteamVR process at start.

          Controller issues make the game unplayable. I haven't tried the dedicated branch of opencomposite.

          No controller issues with the index (using the native build of Alyx).

          ALVR was functional but had an issue with displaying the game too brightly.
          WiVRn worked much better, streamed very clearly. There was a controller issue at first where the left and right lower face buttons cause the view to rotate 90 degrees; difficult to work with as those buttons also serve a gameplay purpose when holding the pistol or syringe. This was fixed by downloading and compiling the latest version of XRizer  (v0.2 at time of writing) and adding it to the launch options as VR_OVERRIDE=/home/<myhomedirectory>/xrizer/target/release/ . Now it works fantastically, best way to play the game on Linux so far!

          In wivrn the game ran perfectly with the newest WiVRn update. The only thing not working properly are the loading screens which isn't a big deal. When the game loads rather than take you to the environment with the map it is just a black screen with ambient audio.
          In ALVR the game worked out of the box no config necessary either.

          Running with SteamVR + Proton the game has severe flickering issues in certain areas.
          The native port does not have those but is borked ootb because of an outdated library.
          To be able to run it I had to install `gperftools` and replace the game library with the system one by doing the following in the HLA root dir:
          ```bash
          rm game/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.0
          cp /usr/lib/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.4.5.5 game/bin/linuxsteamrt64/libtcmalloc_minimal.so.0
          ```
          See here for more info: https://steamcommunity.com/app/546560/discussions/0/4042608198327331164/
          Keep in mind some workshop maps do not work with the native Vulkan version sadly (like Post-Human for example).
          Monado + OpenComposite + Proton did not have flickering issues, but graphic rendering seemed a bit off.
          Performance was a bit stuttery as well.

          linux native refused to launch with monado+xrizer, didn't try opencomposite. had to switch to proton experimental to force the windows version. index controllers behave as expected.

          Game Works Perfectly With XRizer and proton experimental, Native version is borked.
          Also tested a few workshop maps and all of them worked.

          **SteamVR** does not work, as it wouldn't recognize the headset and **Steam Link** can't connect to the PC. With **ALVR** the game launches (after a long setup) and you can play it, but until the first loading screen, where it crashes. I _did_ somehow get **WiVRn** working very well _once_, but the A and X buttons snap turn you 90 degrees to either side, hindering you a lot. Some people suggest using **OpenComposite**, in particular _OrionMoonclaw's "priorities"_ fork of it. I'm not sure whether I set it up wrong or not, but after I installed it the game would close itself just when it should start. I tried deleting everything and setting everything back up, but _I couldn't get it working again_.
          P.S. WiVRn wouldn't work anymore even without OpenComposite, or even on another computer!

          **Native Linux version**  
          The game launches and runs out of the box, but subtitles are broken.
          **Workaround (fix subtitles):**  
          The game expects its install path to be entirely lowercase. You can fix this by creating symlinks:
          ```bash
          # Make Steam path lowercase
          ln -sv ~/.local/share/Steam ~/.local/share/steam
          # Make the game folder lowercase
          ln -sv "/mnt/ssd_kingston/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Half-Life Alyx" "/mnt/ssd_kingston/steamlibrary/steamapps/common/half-life alyx"
          ```
          After this, native subtitles work correctly.

          Playable with xrizer-git. Missing loading screens, but doesn't affect gameplay. Seems like teleport triggers too easily when using continuous/smooth motion (like a deadzone issue), but it could be an issue with the controllers themselves (or I'm holding it wrong).
          - Proton experimental
          - WiVRn-git
          - xrizer-git

          Works perfectly with ALVR 20.14.1, I haven't noticed any bugs and performance is satisfactory. 
          I'm playing on a Laptop with hybrid AMD/Nvidia graphics, so some env variables need to be set in order to make it use the Nvidia GPU rather than the AMD one. Refer to both the ALVR logs and [ALVR documentation](https://github.com/alvr-org/ALVR/wiki/Linux-troubleshooting) for details
