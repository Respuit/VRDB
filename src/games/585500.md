          This is the first installment of Dick Wilde. It doesn't run via the current WiVRn with xrizer (it starts in the screen instead of the headset), but runs ok via ALVR (in SteamVR stable) and Steam Link (SteamVR beta).
          Versions:
          SteamVR stable 2.12.14
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.4 (not used in this video)
          WiVRn 25.9-62-g903a02d with xrizer (not used here, does not work)
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.16.10-273-tkg-eevdf
