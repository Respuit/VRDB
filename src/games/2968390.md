          YES! Hand tracking FULLY works on Linux and this game supporting it proves it. It works perfect under WiVRn AND Steam Link, but in ALVR although it also worked for some reason the game appeared way out of position, above the roof, and thus was unplayable. Tried recentering but nothing changed. Probably a small issue that will be solved in the future.
          For the hand tracking to start working, you have to drop your controllers and keep both hands open with the palm turned to you close to your face for about 10 seconds. It's better to do this when the game is starting of even before that. You can use your hands to interact with both SteamVR and wlx-overlay-s in WiVRn.
          You can see that some of the gestures are not very responsive -- particularly the turning gesture. But as using the quest allows you to easily turn physically, that was not much of a problem. Leaving the guardian was, you can see my messy room sometimes during the video, lol. But still the game is very playable.
