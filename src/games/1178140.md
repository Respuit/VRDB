          WiVRn - works.
          ALVR - doesn't work - has the black screen problem, game only appears when the SteamVR overlay is on, so it's unplayable
          Steam Link - crashes when the game starts
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.6 (not used in this video)
          WiVRn 25.11-2-gb1a325c1 with xrizer (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.6
          kernel 6.17.6-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
