          This one is currently not working on Linux due to partially complete HolographicSpace implementation in Proton https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8457

          Just crash naturally at the start. Same reason as others. https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8457

          Until now, this game did not work because of proton missing some library functions. An individual on the proton bug report sent three patches to create stubs for these functions and I created my own proton build for it. With this proton build, you can run the game with no issues.
          This proton version, that I call protola, is here: https://github.com/Patola/wine/releases/tag/protola-10.0 -- if you are reading this months in the future, the patches are probably already integrated in regular proton. The game works with WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link.
          You can watch the gameplay on Linux here: https://youtu.be/TGT71f40dMg
