          As reported on protondb, you need to copy two OpenCL.dlls from the windows/system32 and windows/syswow64 directories of a windows install (hope you have one) into the compatdata/2274200/pfx/drive_c/windows/system*** directories.
          After that, smooth sailing with OpenComposite.
          With xrizer seems to work too, but joystick input is not recognised, probably specific to HP Reverb G2.

          Works perfeclty with ALVR and WiVRn. Gameplay: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wzVfQ0quVI once you copy the OpenCL.DLL files to the right place, as per previous instructions and protondb. If you don't have an Windows installation you can download the two OpenCL.dll (32-bits and 64-bits) from dll-files.com (32 bits under wow64, 64 bits under system32).

          As others stated, OpenCL.dll needs to be downloaded and placed in wow64 and system32. Beyond that, it works perfectly. I played the campaign through in its entirety with zero hiccups -- a great experience.
