          Falcon BMS functions well under ALVR on Plasma 6 Wayland (BMS using XWayland) with a Quest 3 and an RX 7900 XT. GE-Proton10-4 works. You must run the game in windowed mode, as fullscreen crashes on mission load and borderless borks the render resolution and FOV. Copy the game into a Steam generated proton prefix for easy VR support, even if initially installed with Lutris and GOG. Virpil T50CM throttle, WarBRD/T50CM2 stick (firmware 5/30/25), and CH Pro Pedals recognized out of the box. The Alternative Launcher occasionally goes all black, but switching to a different tab or waiting a bit usually fixes it. Weapons Delivery Planner also appears to work using Wine in flatscreen, but I was unable to get Tacview working properly (UI stays all black).

          Initial Setup was a bit of pain, followed a few guides and had ChatGPT break it down step by step, especially since I'm a n00b when it comes to Linux.
          I've tried ALVR, WiVRn and SteamLink and SteamLink was the easiest/smoothest with the least frustration, while also still looking decent. It's no VirtualDesktop replacement, but it'll have to do for now... 
          ALVR and WiVRn both work, however I noticed WiVRn for me even with cable was giving me significant stutters. ALVR was better but I had to lower the settings for the encode below what I need, and it required significantly more setup
          for SteamLink, I did the Encode width "hack" and set 2208 (for the Quest 3), but because Valve hasn't allowed us customization on the encoder options, it still caps out at I think 1536.
          I'm on a 4090 + 14700k. BMS itself runs extremely well once its set up.
          I'm using a Winwing Orion2 with F-16EX stick and F-15EX throttle, with VKB T.Rudder mk IV. I had to use protontricks/winetricks with explorer to set up my sticks, as well as disable steam input. T-rudder doesn't show in the control panel, but the launcher does still let you bind it fine.
          These are my launch options:
          PROTON_USE_NTSYNC=1 PROTON_ENABLE_HIDRAW=1 STEAM_INPUT=0 bash -c 'exec "${@/common\/Falcon\ 4.0\/falcon4.exe/compatdata\/429530\/pfx\/dosdevices\/f\:\/BMS\/Launcher\/FalconBMS_Alternative_Launcher.exe}"' -- %command%
          Guides I used to help me install:
