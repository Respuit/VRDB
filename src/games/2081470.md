          Launch option `%command% -dx11` was required. Without it, got only 10-20 fps.

          Launch the game in DX11 mode by adding `-dx11` to the end of launch options. (Without this, you will get a crash mentioning DirectX textures.)
          xrizer must be latest `main` branch as of Nov 28, 2025. Anything earlier (including release 0.3.0) will not have working controller buttons, only movement.
          Once these are handled, it plays without any issues.
          Tested on GE-Proton10-20
