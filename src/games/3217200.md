          Game should work perfectly under ALVR, WiVRn and Steam Link, but in the case of Steam Link it needs a special command to be run:
          ln -sf ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/steamxr_linux64.json ~/.config/openxr/1/active_runtime.json
          What this command does is, it informs the system that the current OpenXR backend to use is SteamVR. For some reason SteamVR / Steam Link doesn't do this automatically, and a good number of games fail to start because of it.
          There's also an application called xrpicker-gui (from package xr-picker or xr-picket-git) that might create this link automatically, but it doesn't remove it at this time. If you let this link remain there it might botch e.g. WiVRn.
          Versions:
