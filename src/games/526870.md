          Steps to get it working:
          1. Get UEVR nighlty from https://github.com/praydog/UEVR-nightly/releases (version tested: 01112)
          2. Get configuration from https://github.com/dortamur/satisfactory-uevr-enhancements/raw/master/UEVR/FactoryGameSteam-Win64-Shipping.zip
          3. Get https://builds.dotnet.microsoft.com/dotnet/WindowsDesktop/6.0.25/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.25-win-x64.exe
          4. Get Proton-GE https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/releases/tag/GE-Proton10-17
          5. Install it through protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 526870 --no-background-wineserver ~/Downloads/windowsdesktop-runtime-6.0.25-win-x64.exe
          6. Set compatibility tool to GE-Proton10-17
          7. Start Satisfactory
          8. Configure Satisfactory to use DX11 (in-game configuration, under Video options)
          9. Load a saved game / start a new one. It should show "waiting for UEVR injection on the top left"
          10. Run protontricks-launch --no-bwrap --appid 526870 --no-background-wineserver UEVRInjector.exe (with the correct path to the exe from step 1)
          11. Import configuration from step 2, close the browser window that shows when done
          12. Make sure OpenXR is selected
          13. Click Inject
          You will only have to execute steps 7, 10 and 13 the following times you want to run the game.
          Everything works in game, although performance isn't great.
