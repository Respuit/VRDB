          Works by using latest WiVrn with Xrizer, and Envision for all the setup
          Controllers did not work previously with OpenComposite, but work now
          Only issue : the controller prompts are replaced with ⚠️ but do work

          SteamVR - works perfectly, there used to be a lot of bugs on Linux in general but as of February 2025 I don't see any issues (except usual SteamVR shenanigans)
          Monado/OpenComposite - controller prompts are replaced with a warning sign but still work, on Vive Wands you're forced to use the default controller bindings, and trackpads don't work so I'm unable to turn around.

          Works out of the box - seems to perform really well on my setup via WiVRn.

          No controller glyphs issues with the Valve Index despite previous reports, at least for me. The game does suffer from degraded performance, but it can just be addressed via the graphic settings.

          Works perfectly with ALVR.
          WiVRn mostly works but when entering a ship, cannot grab the throttle with the left hand or use the left hand exit.  Right hand works to grab the stick and door.  Left hand works outside of the ship, pressing the grip curls the fingers and toggles the scanner as it is supposed to.  This is a game breaking bug because you can't really play if you can't fly ships.  Tried with both WiVRn 0.19 and 0.23 - same issue.

           (report made March 16 2025) i was having some serious issues with controller turning (just either didnt work, or was WAY too fast) but i fixed it by switching my compatibility layer, i installed xrizer with AUR, then set the launch option to VR_OVERRIDE=/opt/xrizer, and it worked! hope this helps others

          Used Envision with WiVRn and the experimental2 branch of RinLovesYou/xrizer, there is the ⚠️ glyph issue and another one is that changing FSR scaling options crashes xrizer with a frame out of order error, the setting gets saved and works afterwards, playable.
          Tried using the default Envision profile for WiVRn with OpenComposite, but got the issue of the controller turning way too fast, unplayable.

          WiVRn with xrizer: All I had to do was set the headset resolution down to about 85% and then tweak some in game graphical settings and it looks and plays fantastic. Proton GE 10-10 WiVRn on envision with xrizer. The one problem I do see is that the inputs do not display properly. They just show a yellow exclamation mark triangle. playing with wivrn without xrizer resulted in buttons not working at all.
          overall it is a fantastic experience on WiVRN
          ALVR: I do not know what it is with ALVR on this game but I ticked the resolution and graphics down to the same as WiVRn however it just runs so much slower. I am sure with a bit more tinkering on my end I can get it there, but I feel it might be at some graphical costs.

          I managed to get the game to start using Proton 9.0-4 but it would start in non-vr mode even when forced to within steam's settings.
          The VR headset is stuck in the Next up... screen while the game's audio gets correctly routed to it.
