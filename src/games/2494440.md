          Good points of this game: it works with WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link.
          Bad points of this game: as it's shown in the video, it starts misaligned with all three software (and that also occurs in Windows) and it is resistant against recentering. I kept needing to move within my playspace. Too cumbersome, I ended up refunding the game. There are others of this genre that play much better and also have better and more responsive graphics and controls, for example Rolling Line.
          Versions:
          Proton 9.0-4
          WiVRn 25.9-4-g6ddde98
          Mesa 25.2.3
          Kernel 6.16.8-273-tkg-eevdf
          Not used in this gameplay: SteamVR beta 2.13.4
