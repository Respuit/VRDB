          Needs to be set to the Windows version running under Proton to use the SteamVR launch option; Linux Native doesn't support the VR mode.
          Runs pretty much perfectly otherwise.
          Haven't played a round yet, but the menus, settings, etc are functional.

          Initially it would only launch as a 2D/flatscreen game. I changed it to use Proton (Steam > Library > right click game > Properties > Compatibility > tick 'Force the use of a specific compatibility tool' > Proton OR GE-proton - both worked on my system). Then when launching the game in steam, it gives the option to use SteamVR and works perfectly in VR.
          •WiVRn installed and running to run VR games
          •Meta Quest 3 headset with WiFi connection and WiVRn app installed on it
          •AMD Ryzen 5 7600
          •Nvidia RTX 3060 Ti with proprietary driver
          •Kubuntu 25.04

          Game installs, starts up and runs well, no complaints while in VR. Second screen is able to project manual for expert.
          The native Linux version does not have VR. Force Proton to use the VR version, which works very well on Vive Pro with Valve Index controllers.
          Proton: 10.0-2 (beta)
