          Needs to be set to the Windows version running under Proton to use the SteamVR launch option; Linux Native doesn't support the VR mode.
          Runs pretty much perfectly otherwise.
          Haven't played a round yet, but the menus, settings, etc are functional.

          Initially it would only launch as a 2D/flatscreen game. I changed it to use Proton (Steam > Library > right click game > Properties > Compatibility > tick 'Force the use of a specific compatibility tool' > Proton OR GE-proton - both worked on my system). Then when launching the game in steam, it gives the option to use SteamVR and works perfectly in VR.
