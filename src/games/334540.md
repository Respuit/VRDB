          WiVRn - doesn't work -- controls respond and everything but headtracking for some reason does not work.
          ALVR - works ok
          Steam Link - works perfectly.
          I consider this game the best overall VR mecha game in my reviews. Voice acting is not the best, but it has a proper campaign, you walk outside of the mecha and interact with people having dialogue choices, the controls are great and intuitive, there's lot of interactivity with the panels, the landscapes are very well done, the graphics are great, the menus are well thought out, it has lots of different game modes, the tutorials are very instructive, the combat is complex enough and quite challenging and the story is creative and engaging, with a narrator even.
          I just wish it had more recognition on Steam.
          Versions:
