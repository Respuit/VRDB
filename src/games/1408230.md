          Double vision when running in SteamVR. Some workarounds are mentioned in [a SteamVR Issue](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6449), but haven't managed to get it working in its current state. SteamVR also crashes when opening up the SteamVR menu while the game is running.

          Steam VR and ALVR =  The image seems to be less stable motions in way that feels like your are a step back removed from the players perspective, i tried to mess with the settings to get a decent image without success.
          As for controllers if i look down and just motions the controllers they are very smooth.
          WiVRn  = As probably the best experience running with Xrizer, the image is stable, the only jank seems to be the motion of the controller where it seems to lose tracking sometimes, but overall most playable experience.
