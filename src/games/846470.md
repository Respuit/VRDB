          Crashed because of missing hpmotioncontroller.json file. Copied (with minor modifications) from Moss: Book II and stopped crashing.
          Sadly, with monado+OpenComposite it is only black and never connects to the headset.
          With monado+xrizer it does show up in the headset, but neither controller shows up and works, making it impossible to get past the "Seated Experience" screen.

          Running with ALVR worked out of the box.

          The game doesn't work properly with WiVRn + OpenComposite. It does boot, but it doesn't show up on the headset and the controls do not work. The initial "this is a seated experience" screen cannot be dismissed.
          WiVRn + xrizer makes the game playable without many issues.
          Attempting to open the controls settings menu crashes the game, with xrizer throwing a "this method is not implemented" error.

          Using WiVRn and xrizer with the experimental2 branch of RinLovesYou/xrizer works fine, crashes upon entering the controller screen with a not implemented error, but the controls work so it is playable, the glyphs and 3d controller shown are not the Quest 2 touch controllers but the HTC Vive, mostly just a visual issue.
          Using Envision with the default WiVRn profile with OpenComposite crashes on start, with a "Failed to read and parse JSON binding descriptor" error.
          Using Proton GE 10-1.

          Controller mapping issues with OpenComposite. Pretty sad about it. Decided to refund it due to that.

          The game initially crashed under Monado using the Valve Index headset with the Valve Index controllers due to a missing hpmotioncontroller.json and vive_controller_presstomove.json files. Following another comment here, I copied the Moss Book II files from `~.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Moss Book II/Moss 2/Config/SteamVRBindings` to `~.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/Moss/Moss/Config/SteamVRBindings`
          After that it loaded just fine. However, I landed at a new controller mapping issue. I could use menu buttons and the analogue sticks, but it didn't see my trigger presses, so I couldn't start the game. Trying to open the controller bindings led to the following error:
          > Hit stubbed file at /home/[username]/.local/share/envision/opencomposite/OpenOVR/Reimpl/BaseInput.cpp:2511 func ShcowBindingsForActionSet
          However, I switched to SteamVR at this point, and everything worked perfectly. Minus, you know, the several bugs with SteamVR itself. But the game was buttery smooth.
