          Game should work perfectly under ALVR, WiVRn and Steam Link, but in the case of Steam Link it needs a special command to be run:
          rm -f ~/.config/openxr/1/active_runtime.json ; ln -s ~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/steamxr_linux64.json ~/.config/openxr/1/active_runtime.json
          Don't worry it there's an error message saying the file doesn't exist. It's normal.
          What this command does is, it informs the system that the current OpenXR backend to use is SteamVR. For some reason SteamVR / Steam Link doesn't do this automatically, and a good number of games fail to start because of it.
          There's also an application called xrpicker-gui (from package xr-picker or xr-picket-git) that might create this link automatically, but it doesn't remove it at this time. If you let this link remain there it might botch e.g. WiVRn.
