          SteamVR/ALVR Works but has poor performance as most games via SteamVR do.
          With Monado/WiVRn, OpenComposite crashes, but xrizer does boot.
          Unfortunately, the controllers don't seem to work properly. There's a prompt to reset your HMD view (which is usually done by clicking in right stick); I can get past it by pushing the R key on the keyboard, but I cant use controllers in the menu still, effectively leaving me softlocked.
          Performance already seems great and promising just from the menus, but I can't actually start anything. I opened an issue [here](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xrizer/issues/149).

          This game works with ALVR and Steam Link, but not right out of the box. As shown at the start of the game, you don't even see your pointers, so you have to change the default controller bindings to a community one. The one I chose on the video, from SpartanWarrior, is the one I found most comfortable, although sprinting is a little awkward (you have to double-click the left stick, but click once to be able to walk). You only need to do this once.
          Note that at the start screen, another way to skip the two-thumbsticks requirement is just pressing R on the keyboard, but if the controllers are not working the menus will still be unresponsive.
          With WiVRn, this is not easy because it cannot use steam input for controls, and there is a bug in xrizer (#149 in xrizer's github) where it makes the game detect the Valve Knuckles instead of the Oculus Touch controllers. It might even be possible to brute-force it by overwriting some game files and doing some black magic to create a mapping, but until the xrizer bug is resolved my advice is to just use ALVR or Steam Link.
          Notice that in the past ALVR had terrible performance with this game but this situation has improved a lot, and Steam Link also has acceptable performance, so it's not unplayable by any means.
          Versions tested:
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5
          WiVRn 25.9-74-g1dd0ed4 with xrizer
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.17.3-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4

          External controller profile needs to be downloaded using SteamVR overlay, make sure to select one with full controls, including sprint.
          Played for over 2 hours without any issues.

          Occasional graphical glitches occur, Y-axis of left analog is inverted, use attached file to replace controller profile located in
