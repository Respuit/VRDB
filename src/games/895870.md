          Crash at start, in VR mode due to UE4 VR issues on Proton. See https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8409

          It launch perfectly using proton experimental, I had performance issues with the game itself but running it I had no technical issues. It doesn't use the VR controllers and only accepts normal input devices like a Flight stick. I'm on kwin wayland w/ a 4060 using wired setup on alvr.
