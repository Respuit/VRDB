          Crash at start, in VR mode due to UE4 VR issues on Proton. See https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/8409

          It launch perfectly using proton experimental, I had performance issues with the game itself but running it I had no technical issues. It doesn't use the VR controllers and only accepts normal input devices like a Flight stick. I'm on kwin wayland w/ a 4060 using wired setup on alvr.

          Used `proton-cachyos`. Both OpenComposite and XRizer work.
          Monado works with `-vr -hmd=OpenXR` appended to launch options. Do not change client scale or enable parallel views, as this tends to crash either game or GPU (This was on AMD, not so sure about NVIDIA).
          I've tried WiVRn on Nvidia, and for some reason `-vr -hmd=OpenXR` doesn't work properly (game renders only UI), but changing it to `-vr -hmd=SteamVR` works.
          Game is from GOG, Steam version may require additional tweaks, since it appends `-vr -hmd=SteamVR` automatically.
          this was on 6700xt and 5090
