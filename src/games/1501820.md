          It doesn't work on WiVRn. On ALVR and Steam Link, it starts and plays nice until the point in the game where you have to pass through speeding tunnels, then it hangs. Opened a bug report here: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/9075 and will update with a new report if they fix it.
