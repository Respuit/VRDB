          Only played briefly, but runs pretty well.
          Hand models are offset weirdly. Not sure if it's playable using VR controllers, but the menus are usable with them. Probably best to use a wheel, but keyboard also works.
          HMD view defaults to inside the seat. Recentre with Q+E (look left + look right bindings)
          Oddly, running through Envision with my old WMR headset defaults to a usable view position instead.
          Running through Content Manager, it fails to find VR (despite the vanilla launcher doing so just fine) but otherwise works well in desktop mode.

          - No issues in menu as they are not in VR
          - No issues with inputs as I'm using a wheel
          Performance is fine, recentering is needed with keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Space

          Works perfect, only complaint is the ride hight is very low and needs to he manually configured through the in game ui, gamepad works fine, modded gameplay is the same and CM had no issues with the headset.
