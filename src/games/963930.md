          I was unable to play some maps because they would become incredibly stuttery. I let them sit for a bit but it never seemed to improve.

          Running with envision to set up the runtime but it runs rather well. System specs are 7900xtx with 12400 and 32 gigs of ddr4 ram. The game doesn't stutter and runs relatively fine.
