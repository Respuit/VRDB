          A crafting zombie VR game in a sunny environment. You'd think it would be Arizona Sunshine but it's instead this indie game. Which has a terrible interface with ultra-slow smooth turning and terribly dark environments and it needs you to configure for the left hand for the controls to be normal.
          The redeeming point is that it works under all: WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link.
          Versions:
          SteamVR stable 2.12.14
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.4 (not used in this video)
          WiVRn 25.9-62-g903a02d with xrizer (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.16.11-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
