          This is a cumbersome RPG made for VR. It seems ok but kind of overwhelming, there's too much, crafting, mining, basebuilding, etc. and the interface is not very good, it's too verbose. Seems to have content for hundreds of hours. There have been some updates with new content lately, it's a miracle that this is still active and with so many people working on it.
          It works perfectly under WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5
          WiVRn 25.9-74-g1dd0ed4 with xrizer (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.17.3-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
