          The first Dick Wilde I played using ALVR, so this one is with WiVRn. But it works via Steam Link too!
          Versions tested:
          SteamVR stable 2.12.14 with ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5
          WiVRn 25.9-62-g903a02d with xrizer
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.16.11-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
