          Server gets spammed with:
          ```
          WARN [wait_semaphore] Waiting on client semaphore value '1' timed out > 100ms!`
          ```
          The game never fully starts and just sits on a black screen.

          Works nearly perfectly, hovering over menu options and putting your finger on the capacitive sensor will count as clicking though, in game gunplay works fine and stable.

          I recorded test gameplay [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19KX3ZmXvkA) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeIWFnPH75U). 
          What I got were really bad stutters/freezes/disconnections every 10-30 seconds (both display and controllers), with great performance in between: perfect latency and clarity/resolution. Also, there's a bug in the menus where only touching the trigger registers as a click instead of actually pulling the trigger, as yayameowmeow mentioned. Arguably the performance is not usable, but it still boots and runs, I would just suggest using ALVR instead until it improves.

          Using the latest Monado/OpenComposite/etc., and setting up OpenXR properly according to https://monado.freedesktop.org/valve-index-setup.html#3-configure-the-openxr-runtime (I used that guide in its entirety instead of Envision to make sure that every step worked correctly.), the game takes a minute to launch, but otherwise runs great under Monado.
          I also used proton experimental to make sure that all the EAC bits worked correctly, which I had no problem with.
          The game is a stuttery mess under SteamVR, like most games under SteamVR.

          Testing with WiVRn on a fresh install of Fedora with Proton Experimental, it works great on Quest 2. Very rarely, I will get frame drops, but I assume that's because of USB throughput or Wifi lag spikes. Sometimes, a visual glitch occurs where after firing a rifle with a magnified scope, what is seen through the scope doesn't update, but dying and respawning fixes this.
          On Quest 3/WiVRn, the game launches, but when I get to the main menu, I cannot see my hands or where I'm selecting, but I can still select items in the menu. On top of this, no background will load in the main menu, and I get zero visuals when in the shooting range (I can still interact with items and shoot, strangely enough). I suspect this is an issue with how pavlov loads in controllers, but its just a hunch.
          Testing with ALVR, the game would start briefly, get past the anticheat screen, then crash on both Q2 and Q3.
