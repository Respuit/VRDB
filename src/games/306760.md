          Game doesn’t start in vr mode with wivrn/opencomposite. Crashes with xrizer. ALVR works with legacy reprojection toggled on in steamvr dashboard (per app video settings) . 
          The menu in the game is also broken and it’s almost impossible to select options in VR and once the game starts the pause menu is inaccessible, however this seems to be an issue on windows as well.
