          From the get-go, the “Press and hold controller triggers to charge a punch” isn't reliably working, despite relying working on the same key, to shoot things. In the case you are stuck at that tutorial part, you can always "surrender" in the option menu, and go back to the title screen.
          Also didn't get any sound from the game, but that might be able to be worked around via Pipewire.
