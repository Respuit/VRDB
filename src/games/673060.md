          Works with Steam Link just perfectly.
          It also works in WiVRn, but starts miscentered and the controls are different and very bad there (you have to select stuff by pressing the thumbstick).
          It works in ALVR with the controls set right.
          Versions:
          Proton 9.0-4
          WiVRn 25.9-21-g4e5eca2 (not used here)
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used here)
          SteamVR beta 2.13.4
          Mesa 25.2.3
          kernel 6.16.9-273-tkg-eevdf
