          This is one of the VERY FEW games that support VR in the NATIVE LINUX build, without using proton!
          It doesn't use the spatial controllers, but it's very nice nonetheless.
          It's an odd, low-poly, bright game, and a little confusing at first, but the gameplay is indeed great. It resembles the old X universe games, like X: Tension or X2. It's nice that you can dock on planet cities!
          I've used my Steam Controller emulating mouse and keyboard to play.
          It works in all three: WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5 (not used in this video)
          WiVRn 25.9-74-g1dd0ed4 with xrizer
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.17.3-273-tkg-eevdf
          NO PROTON USED
          Gameplay here (via WiVRn): https://youtu.be/m92sCttO5VI
