          Pierhead Arcade 2 from 2019 is MUCH better than the first installment from 2016 and has proper locomotion.
          And it works in WiVRN whilst the first one crashes xrizer. This one also works under ALVR and Steam Link, of course.
          Versions tested:
          ALVR v20.14.1 with SteamVR stable
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5
          WiVRn 25.9-62-g903a02d with xrizer
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.16.11-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
