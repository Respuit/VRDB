          WiVRn - works but shows lots of reprojection. Very unpleasant to play with it.
          ALVR - doesn't work - controllers don't click for some reason.
          Steam Link - works perfectly!
          This is a (supposedly) short VR game made by Bethesda as an experiment.
          Versions tested:
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR 2.14.5
          WiVRn 25.12-10-g3df615cb with xrizer
          Mesa 25.3.2
          kernel 6.18.2-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 10.0-3
