          Works via ALVR and Steam Link. In WiVRn, though, it crashes xrizer.
          The Steam Link bug with a black screen seems to have been resolved in beta 2.13.5.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 with SteamVR stable
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.5
          WiVRn 25.9-62-g903a02d with xrizer (it crashes)
          Mesa 25.2.4
          Kernel 6.16.11-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4
