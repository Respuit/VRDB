          Trying to start the game via WiVRn makes xrizer crash, I didn't try with opencomposite. Both ALVR and Steam Link work.  Steam Link still shows these blackout bugs but by making the overlay appear and disappear it's solved for now. This bug will eventually be resolved.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          SteamVR beta 2.13.4

          Mesa 25.2.3
          Kernel 6.16.8-273-tkg-eevdf
