          I played this game all the way through using SteamVR. I used a standard Proton version so no GE or any other kind. I've not tested anything else, but I had zero problems using SteamVR with Proton 9.0. The full game ran flawlessly, with no tinkering required. I had no hiccups or strange frame drops either. It was all smooth as butter.

          Works perfectly with WiVRN, ALVR and Steam Link. In the past it didn't work, but a proton fix made it playable: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6413
          Versions tested:
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR 2.14.4
          WiVRn 25.11.1-171-gfc6fcda0 with xrizer
          Mesa 25.3.2
          kernel 6.18.2-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 10.0-3
