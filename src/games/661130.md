          Runs pretty much perfectly, haven't seen any issues in the short time I've spent playing.
          Haven't tested microphone since I have no one to talk to there.

          Both desktop and vr are pretty much perfectly playable with the stock steam stack, aside from issues resultant from user generated content and issues unique to your headset (for instance, 48khz audio on my index). You should either run with `--enable-libvlc` to use that backend for video players, or use ge-proton-rtsp (the latter seems to work better for me). If you see an object in vr which only renders in one eye or has fucked up normals, its not a fault of your configuration. These are both examples of 'legacy content' before the move to spsi rendering in unity; the former is still using the shaders they were uploaded with and the latter is using a 'shader replacement tech' which lets both eyes render it, but generally causes a degraded visual experience.
          Monado (libsurvive and the proprietary lighthouse stack) work as well, but at the moment I can't figure out how to get my finger motions to the game.

          Runs perfectly via SteamVR however i would recommend using ge-proton-rtsp as video players don't seem to work on otherwise i also got slightly better performance with ge-proton-rtsp. 
          I had several issues with Monado it is playable but not as good as SteamVR.
