          Tested on Proton 9.0-4. This title is OpenXR, so the choice between OpenComposite or XRizer won't matter. However, either must be installed for VR to be detected.

          SteamVR - game works but during level transitions game causes my GPU to crash, forcing me to either restart SteamVR or entire PC.
          Monado - controller tracking doesn't work and there are visual artifacts in the menu.

          Used Envision with the default WiVRn profile with OpenComposite, no issues. Using Proton GE 10-1.

          I have not encountered any issues with the singleplayer mode (note that I have not played much of it), however I have encountered frequent crashing within the multiplayer. From my research into a resolution, I got the impression that it is a general issue not as a result of Proton/Linux. Saying this, the game is enjoyable enough to work around the crashing, as of writing this Into the Radius 2 is still in very early access and such problems are to be expected -- especially from a studio who has, to my knowledge, not worked with multiplayer in the past.

          In flatpak wivrn, due to monado's reprojection time issue, screen shaking issue occurs, so I recommend using envision or build WiVRn standalone. In uvuntu 24.04 lts, I confirmed that it works well on GE-Proton-9-22 and 27.

          ITR2 version 0.14.0.  ALVR v20.14.1.  WiVrn v25.9.  GE-Proton10-25.
          Game works well in both DX11/DX12 modes via ALVR.  WiVrn has issues with intense headset tracking jitter, rending the game unplayable.  Will sometimes hang on level load/transitions, so be sure to save before attempting a transition.

          The game always launches but doesn't actually stream to the headset when using ALVR. WiVRn streams to the headset, but the stutter is bonkers and unplayable.
