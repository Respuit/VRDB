          Works well in ALVR and Steam Link, doesn't start in VR in WiVRn (starts in the screen, and can't be interacted with).

          This is an obvious indie game that is two very bad short horror games (Baba Yaga and the Killers Creepers) + a never realized game (P.T.) in one. Baba Yaga is something like Monstrum without items in a cave and Killers Creepers is very much Slender: The Arrival with unreasonable levels of fog. Works both via ALVR and Steam Link, doesn't start in VR if run via WiVRn.
          The controls of this game are clunky, because you have to press X to run instead of thumbstick. And it also doesn't have strafing. But to be frank I like the games of this developer, specially the Z.O.N.A. series where he learned a lot more (and these have strafing and normal run).
          Versions:
          Steam Link 2.13.3
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.2
          kernel 6.16.7-273-tkg-eevdf
          Note: yes, at the end of this gameplay I was bored AF, I just wanted to find the killer and be unalived because the game shows no in-game menu with an exit function.
