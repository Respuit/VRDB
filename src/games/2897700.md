          **CPU**: i9 9900 - **GPU**: RTX 2080 mobile - **Driver**: 550.163.01 (555 - 580 seem to have issues with async reprojection)
          - **Steam VR**
          Steam VR with async reprojection disabled works better on my hardware, hands are "doubled" when moving, does not happen when enabled. Enabled is mostly smooth but has slight stutters even though it's running at 45 FPS only:
          `$HOME/.local/share/Steam/config/steamvr.vrsettings`:
          ```json
          "steamvr" : {
              "enableLinuxVulkanAsync" : false
          }
          ```
          - **Mondado**
          Envision env vars:
          ```
          XRT_COMPOSITOR_USE_PRESENT_WAIT=1
          U_PACING_COMP_TIME_FRACTION_PERCENT=90
          XRT_COMPOSITOR_COMPUTE=1
          XRT_COMPOSITOR_SCALE_PERCENTAGE=140
          U_PACING_APP_USE_MIN_FRAME_PERIOD=1
          U_PACING_APP_IMMEDIATE_WAIT_FRAME_RETURN=1 
          XRT_COMPOSITOR_DESIRED_MODE=0              # set index to 90 Hz
          XRT_CURATED_GUI=1
          XRT_JSON_LOG=1
          XRT_DEBUG_UI=1
          ```
          Monado needs `OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 %command%` as launch option in Steam. It stutters a lot on my machine, but when lowering ingame scaling factor to 0.7, which still looks fine it runs smooth.
