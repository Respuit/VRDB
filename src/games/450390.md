          It works mostly as normal and you can play most of the games and everything looks clean, although sometimes it either suffers slowdown or randomly crashes during a game. Also 2 of the games crash each time you try to load them, those being robot repair and secret shop, and loading screens mess up due to it not using steamvr, but thats purely visual. 
          PC is Ethernet wired, 5Ghz network on headset, latest version of wiVRn with envision, and proton version was tested with both GE-Proton8-16 and the latest experimental, and im using the latest drivers for nvidia

          Most of the games/experiences are playable, but some (e.g. Secret Shop) do result in the game freezing.

          Occasional crashes and minor graphical issues in the loading splash screens. Some of the mini games are too awkward to play because the controller orientation for the Valve Index is incorrect.

          Two of the experiences, Secret Shop and Robot Repair, do not work. The screen goes cloudy like it's loading the level in, but you never leave the hub world.
