          Just out of the box experience - default Steam Proton settings, no meddling. Game just run on my 4080, 470 drivers, Wayland, KDE Plasma DE.

          Game opens a desktop window with a cursor that doesn't respond to mouse movement or controller movement, nothing shows up in the headset.

          ALVR works just fine, though the game is darker than it should be. It's better after turning on "Force HDR sRGB Correction", but i would still recommend to use 2.2 gamma to get better darker colors. 
          WiVRn crashes on startup and I found no way to fix it.

          Opens a black window, and a pop up showing "Fatal error" (same behavior with both OpenComposite and xrizer)

          If you just try to run metro awakening it gives you a "Fatal error!" dialog box and bails out. For it to work, you have to apply this small patch on the code: https://gist.github.com/Patola/4a033c9df7da8f7c388ca33012419efc
          You should be using envision, of course, to compile wivrn. So you save the gist file as `~/.local/share/envision/wivrn/patches/monado/0013-metro_awakening_ignore_malformed.patch` and then Ctrl-F5 on envision for a Clean Build. This way it ignores an initialization check and starts the game. Everything works now, I've completed the game this way.
          The wivrn bug report for that is this one: https://github.com/WiVRn/WiVRn/issues/232 → it was closed because it's just a compliance verification that wivrn cannot skip, and so far I only know this game that it prevents from starting. I also opened a bug report at Plaion, Metro Awakening's publisher, explaining the issue in details, but they never fixed it. That was 6 months ago.
          The game runs _much better_ in WiVRn than ALVR. It defies comparison.
          Note: please verify my good standing in github and the wivrn community, you should not apply code changes from anyone on the internet. If you know programming, you can also check that what the patch does it pretty tame.

          Works great in SteamVR through ALVR.
          Crashes on startup with WiVRn.
