          WiVRn - doesn't work, same as the previous game: splash screen starts in VR, then game continues, unresponsive, on the screen.
          ALVR - works.
          Steam Link - works.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.6
          WiVRn 25.9-145-g07bc8c9 with xrizer (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.6
          kernel 6.17.6-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 9.0-4 (different from the previous game, this one doesn't need GE-Proton to work)
