          I can't get SteamVR to work on my PC; I have to install OpenComposite.
          The graphical flaws are minor.

          The game played pretty well, but having multiple video cameras active at once tanked the performance when using WiVRn, on virtual desktop with windows on the same settings there is no performance hit
          I also cannot hear when other people talk in the lobby when using WiVRn, when ingame the voice chat works
