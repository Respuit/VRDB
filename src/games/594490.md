          WiVRn - doesn't work, keeps waiting on a load screen which curiously enough says it's the "Deadly Hunter VR Demo".
          ALVR - works.
          Steam Link - works.
          FREE wave shooter on Steam that looks good but is very bad.
          A very crappy, clumsy old game with multiple glaring bugs and input handling mishaps (you can see that I often can't fit the arrow to the arc) that can be deceiving due to its good trailers and screenshots. I don't recommend.
          It doesn't have smooth locomotion nor smooth turning. It doesn't have relevant settings either. Its forum is dead since 2023. For some reason it still has "very positive" reviews.
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1
          Steam Link via SteamVR 2.14.5
          WiVRn 25.12-52-g5bb73100 with xrizer
          Mesa 25.3.3
          kernel 6.18.3-273-tkg-eevdf
          Proton 10.0-3
