          The game launches just fine with the latest version of the RepoXR mod and with the default WiVRn profile in Envision. Latency and stability are good, and the game runs without any noticeable issues in regards to visuals, gameplay and tracking. No manual configuration required.

          When launching through r2modman, Steam launch options are not used
          This meant `PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW` was not set for me, causing this error
          ```
          Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : RuntimeInterface::LoadRuntime skipping manifest file C:\openxr\wineopenxr64.json, negotiation failed with error -6
          ```
          I corrected this by getting the required modded launch options from r2modman from
          `Help -> General -> Launching the game from outside the mod manager`
          And adding them to my Steam launch options, to launch the modded game through Steam
          This was my final launch options:
          ```
          PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wivrn/comp_ipc" PROTON_LOG=+openxr,+vrclient %command% --doorstop-enable true --doorstop-target "Z:/home/diffy/.config/r2modmanPlus-local/REPO/profiles/Default/BepInEx/core/BepInEx.Preloader.dll" --r2profile "Default"
          ```

          ## SteamVR (Steam Link)
          > Important to note that this testing was done through Steam Link, I have not tested physical connections, or using SteamVR through another runtime like ALVR
          Kind of on the fence between "Playable with issues" and "Unplayable with issues". Every time I have used Steam Link on my setup (tested with both Garuda and CachyOS) my game would be locked to 30 FPS (which I consider unplayable, but others might believe is playable), even when playing around with all the video settings in SteamVR. I also noticed that text in this game looked like it had a chromatic aberration effect on it.
          ## WiVRn
          Worked *almost* perfectly out of the box, but this wasn't an issue with RepoXR per-se. Any game would just not connect to WiVRn at all, but the next day after a reboot it worked flawlessly. Likely my problem was fixed by just "turning it off and on again". When using wireless, WiVRn would be my best suggestion.
