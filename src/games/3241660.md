          The game launches just fine with the latest version of the RepoXR mod and with the default WiVRn profile in Envision. Latency and stability are good, and the game runs without any noticeable issues in regards to visuals, gameplay and tracking. No manual configuration required.

          When launching through r2modman, Steam launch options are not used
          This meant `PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW` was not set for me, causing this error
          ```
          Error [GENERAL | xrEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties | OpenXR-Loader] : RuntimeInterface::LoadRuntime skipping manifest file C:\openxr\wineopenxr64.json, negotiation failed with error -6
          ```
          I corrected this by getting the required modded launch options from r2modman from
          `Help -> General -> Launching the game from outside the mod manager`
          And adding them to my Steam launch options, to launch the modded game through Steam
          This was my final launch options:
          ```
          PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wivrn/comp_ipc" PROTON_LOG=+openxr,+vrclient %command% --doorstop-enable true --doorstop-target "Z:/home/diffy/.config/r2modmanPlus-local/REPO/profiles/Default/BepInEx/core/BepInEx.Preloader.dll" --r2profile "Default"
          ```
