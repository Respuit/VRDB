          There were issues with hand placement in WiVRn, but a recent commit fixed them!

          Was working perfectly out of the box with wivrn and envision but the latest release of wivrn, just wont attach a headset to the game, the latest nightly build does work perfectly if you disable the performance overlay bind (otherwise you wont be-able to spawn the rock-cam).
          Have not personally tried alvr+steamvr but I hear that setup works perfectly with no configuration needed.
