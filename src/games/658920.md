          On ALVR the game runs perfectly on versions of proton around version 9, but the crossbow has an issue with rendering the scope unless you mess with performance settings, mainly anti aliasing, which fixes it until you restart the game. On WiVRn, it doesn't launch, not on opencomposite or xrizer.

          It seems to work perfectly, but I haven't got to the part where I get the crossbow, so I haven't experienced the glitch people are talking about.
          There's some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zitfLfmcjew
          Unfortunately I could not make it work under WiVRn so far.
          Take note that there was an old bug with this mod -- only on Linux -- where if you used the Index Knuckles you would need to click both buttons at the same time to select something and you could not climb ladders. This bug seems to be resolved now.
