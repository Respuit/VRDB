          On ALVR the game runs perfectly on versions of proton around version 9, but the crossbow has an issue with rendering the scope unless you mess with performance settings, mainly anti aliasing, which fixes it until you restart the game. On WiVRn, it doesn't launch, not on opencomposite or xrizer.

          It seems to work perfectly, but I haven't got to the part where I get the crossbow, so I haven't experienced the glitch people are talking about.
          There's some gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zitfLfmcjew
          Unfortunately I could not make it work under WiVRn so far.
          Take note that there was an old bug with this mod -- only on Linux -- where if you used the Index Knuckles you would need to click both buttons at the same time to select something and you could not climb ladders. This bug seems to be resolved now.

          Due to the game being 32bit, I've only managed to get the game working on Arch Linux using specific 32bit packages for WiVRn and xrizer. Fedora didn't work as 32bit isn't very well supported.
          Proton version: `9.0-4`
          Required AUR packages: `wivrn-multilib-git`, `lib32-xrizer-git` and `xrizer-git`

          I had to tinker a lot with it even launching, firstly trying ALVR, i managed to launch it but inside of the VR the steamVR loading screen still was there telling me that it's loading; later i tried WiVRn with xrizer (OpenComposite doesn't work since HL2 is 32bit iirc) which didn't need a lot of tinkering to launch with, but I couldn't grab items and props, the input hints said the bindings were unbound for some reason, couldn't get them to be bound, even with editing the controls json files; after that I tried ALVR again, but now it doesn't want to launch at all, putting me straight back to the steam home whenever I try to launch the game.
          IMO the best option to play this is to use WiVRn ('wivrn-dashboard', 'wivrn-multilib-git' packages on AUR) with xrizer ('lib32-xrizer', 'xrizer-common', 'xrizer' packages on AUR) and pray that the controls work or try to tinker around with them.
          Edit: after tinkering with steam and changing the graphics card it used (apparently it used the intel iGPU instead of the nvidia dGPU (on gnome you can change the way it starts in steam.desktop' file by changing 'exec=' to "prime-run steam")) ALVR started to fully work; i think that if/when xrizer devs make editing controls easier the game should run well on both WiVRn with xrizer and ALVR with SteamVR.
