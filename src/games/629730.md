          - Cannot scroll menus
          - Cannot select spells
          - Movement stops when pointing at a map, but you can just start moving again (I don't know if this is intentional)
          Other than that, very good experience.

          Worked perfectly although very resource intensive compared to native Windows for some reason on GEProton9-25. No issues otherwise.

          Works well using Xrizer, but you currently cannot use spells

          Hand spells do not function properly, rendering half the games name unplayable, hand to hand and sword combat works as expected though.

          Works almost perfectly on SteamVR, except for occasional lag. 
          Using Wivrn, spells work for me on Xrizer (they don't on opencomposite), except that they get stuck a lot and I have to fling my hands Again to get them to activate. It's also unuably laggy, everything freezes at 0.5-1s lengths every few seconds. and I can't jump as high because of the lag.
