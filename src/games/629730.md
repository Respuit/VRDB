          - Cannot scroll menus
          - Cannot select spells
          - Movement stops when pointing at a map, but you can just start moving again (I don't know if this is intentional)
          Other than that, very good experience.

          Worked perfectly although very resource intensive compared to native Windows for some reason on GEProton9-25. No issues otherwise.

          Works well using Xrizer, but you currently cannot use spells

          Hand spells do not function properly, rendering half the games name unplayable, hand to hand and sword combat works as expected though.

          Works almost perfectly on SteamVR, except for occasional lag. 
          Using Wivrn, spells work for me on Xrizer (they don't on opencomposite), except that they get stuck a lot and I have to fling my hands Again to get them to activate. It's also unuably laggy, everything freezes at 0.5-1s lengths every few seconds. and I can't jump as high because of the lag.

          Everything worked on ALVR, however, my performance was really bad. This may be due to the fact that NVENC decoding is broken on ALVR for NixOS right now, so I was using software decoding. On Wivrn + Opencomposite (the default) I had decent performance but many controller issues. I couldn't scroll in most menus, the left trigger barely worked, and the spell wheel rarely let me select anything. I then tried Xrizer by selecting it in Wivrn and also setting the option manually in `~/.config/openvr/openvrpaths.vrpath`. This fixed my left trigger and spell wheel, the only bug being left was not being able to scroll certain menus. I also got the highest performance with Xrizer. Wivrn + Xrizer seems to make this game run pretty much flawlessly for me.
