          Monado with both OpenComposite and xrizer starts fine, but both controllers don't show up and you can't get past the "Seated Experience" screen. Very likely an issue with the HP Reverb G2 Control Mapping, as it was missing in Moss (the original) entirely and had the same issue when the mapping of this game was copied to it.
