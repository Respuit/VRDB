          Ok, this one is complicated. It seems to work very well with WIRED headsets (Valve Index, which I have, but also HTC Vive), but won't work on the wireless solutions (WiVRn, Steam Link or ALVR). The symptom: the game starts in a black screen and you quickly see some thin red threads which fade away. You can hear music but apparently you can't do anything, although you can hear sounds like your input was recognized. What should happen: the 3D splash screen of tempestfall should appear, and then the menu for you to select your game.
          This issue also happens (or happened) on Windows, though, and people use Virtual Desktop to be able to play the game on Quest, as it seems.
          To make things worse, although the game is great, it has been delisted since it is a warhammer: age of sigmar licensed game and the license for the developer expired. So you can't buy it anymore and I can't add the game to my curator list either.
