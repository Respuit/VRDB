          VR session ends immediately after starting, no error message in the logs (just "Disabling OpenXR" right after enabling it). This is using the native Linux build of BeamNG.drive 0.34.

          Everything worked with correctly configured WiVRn environment using envision. You may be able to get the proton version to work, but its easier to use the linux native build by `cd ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/BeamNG.drive/BinLinux` and then launching the game with `PRESSURE_VESSEL_FILESYSTEMS_RW=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/wivrn/comp_ipc:/var/lib/flatpak/app/io.github.wivrn.wivrn ./BeamNG.drive.x64`.
          Once the game is open you can enable VR mode in display settings like normal and if WiVRn is running it should start streaming to the headset. The game uses OpenXR for its VR Implementation fyi.

          Run the game using OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 to avoid double vision for UI elements.
          The game uses a hardcoded list of Vulkan extensions, so it will often break when an OpenXR runtime changes its requirements. Currently, it only works with Monado using [a patch to hide one extension](https://www.beamng.com/threads/experimental-virtual-reality.94206/page-34#post-1813839).

          Since the latest update the game works perfectly out of the box in native Linux version, but you still have to run it manually since it's no yet on Steam.
