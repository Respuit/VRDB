          The game works extremely well, when using either opencomposite or xrizer. Only problem seemed to be (for me) that the menu wasn't where I was actually looking at (aka, looked towards my monitor, and the game's menu and gameplay were behind me). Overall very good experience in VR (VR isn't on Linux Native version, using Proton is required for VR Support).
          By "Manual Configuration" I mean, that you may want to check the VR Options in-game, as the world scale may be a bit off in VR.
