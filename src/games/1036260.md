          * Doesn't work via WiVRn because the controls don't click on anything
          * Doesn't work via Steam Link because of the dreaded black screen issue
          * Works perfectly via ALVR, as you can see in the referenced gameplay. But the current version of ALVR has sound broken with SteamVR beta, so I had to get back to SteamVR stable for it to work. This will be fixed in the future.
          Smooth turning is very slow in this game and there is no way to set the speed. Sorry for that.
          Versions:
          * ALVR v20.14.1
          * SteamVR 2.12.14
          * WiVRn 25.9-53-gdb91edf (not used here)
          * kernel 6.16.10-273-tkg-eevdf
          * mesa 25.2.4
          * Proton 9.0-4
