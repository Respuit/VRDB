          Activating the VR mode is convoluted and this mode is experimental and very buggy, but it works well in all three VR streaming solutions.

          Instructions to make it work:
          - Use Proton 10 (currently beta2) or superior as compatibility tool
          - use these launch options: `cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="${cmd[-1]%/*}/EscapeTheBackrooms/Binaries/Win64/Backrooms-Win64-Shipping.exe"; "${cmd[@]}"`
