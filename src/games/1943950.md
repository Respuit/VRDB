          Activating the VR mode is convoluted and this mode is experimental and very buggy, but it works well in all three VR streaming solutions.
          Gameplay via Steam Link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngMGnHCCbq8&t=1987s
          Instructions to make it work:
          - Use Proton 10 (currently beta2) or superior as compatibility tool
          - use these launch options: `cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="${cmd[-1]%/*}/EscapeTheBackrooms/Binaries/Win64/Backrooms-Win64-Shipping.exe"; "${cmd[@]}"`

          Escape the backrooms has a hidden VR game. It's hidden because it's very buggy. On the other hand, it works. On Linux, to make it start in VR mode, change the launch parameters to: cmd=(%command%); cmd[-1]="${cmd[-1]%/*}/EscapeTheBackrooms/Binaries/Win64/Backrooms-Win64-Shipping.exe"; "${cmd[@]}"
          Then change its compatibility to Proton 10 or superior, start your VR (Steam Link, ALVR, WiVRn - it works with all) and then start the game. It should recognize the HMD and work out of the box.
          Versions:
          SteamVR beta 2.13.4
          Mesa 25.2.2
          kernel 6.16.7-273-tkg-eevdf
