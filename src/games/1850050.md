          Another perfect, flawless experience for me (4080, 470 drivers, KDE Plasma) - working out of the box. No meddling, no issues.

          So the game works both via ALVR and Wivrn, but there is a big problem for me with the Wivrn - strange jittering. It starts out of the box, no problems with playing, but the jittering makes the game nauseating or making your eyes tired very fast. 
          No issues with ALVR.

          Game works great, however you may need to do some setup before playing, especially if you add the game as a non-steam game. If the game launches but throws a wine loader C error, you need to go to Alien Rogue Incursion/Engine/Extras/Redist/en-us/ and find UEPrereqSetup_x64.exe. You need to add it as a non steam game, and add STEAM_COMPAT_DATA_PATH=<prefix path for Alien Rogue Incursion> in the launch options. Then run the exe and install all the dependencies. The game should then launch. 
          Another issue that is not exclusive to Linux, the game expects you to be running the game with meta quest link runtime if you are using a quest. If you are not using quest link (which you are not on Linux) there is no way to reach the pause menu in game. The best way around this is to make a custom controller binding in steam VR. I made a chord and had it activate index_menu when i pressed X+Y, you should then be able to get the pause menu.
