          It works, the game is playable however the left system key that SteamVR uses conflicts with the in-game menu, so key reassignments are needed (or choosing a community system configuration). Also, the sniping camera that works on Windows by showing a floating screen with the aim simply blacks out the screen on Linux. Will check again in the future to see if this improved. Also, at this moment couldn't make it work with WiVRn.
