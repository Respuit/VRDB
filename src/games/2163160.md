          WiVRn - works and the height can be dynamically adjusted.
          ALVR - works but has wrong height
          Steam Link - works but has wrong height
          Ok, this is an indie early access game that has the best, more comprehensive controls I've seen in a mecha game, that makes it close to games like VTOL VR and actual flight simulators.
          The developer is very responsive and the updates are constant. Don't mind the relative simplicity of the graphics: they work, they feel legitimate, and you get used to the aesthetics of the game pretty quickly. Still, the scenarios and levels are well done, feel purposeful, and the tactical depth of this game is incredible.
          In the middle of the video I try some crazy combinations of loadouts for some skirmish but when the scenario is starting, the game crashes. That is expected of early access, still the game is stable enough that I could take part of a small battle at the end.
          I highly recommend this game. It is very well done and very good on what it proposes.
