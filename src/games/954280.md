          Proton: 3,4: Does not boot
          Proton 5.0: Boots, but not in SteamVR mode, even if it is selected.
          Proton 5.13.6+: Boots in Steam VR mode, controllers not functional.
          There are two versions of this game: one with VR and one without. The VR version requires Proton. The Linux version on the standalone version is outdated, so Proton is still recommended.
          Game loads to the menu on Proton between 5.13 and 10, but on all these revisions, the controllers refuse to bind. This is because of an Input Manifest file not being found on runtime, and the only way to interact with the menu in VR is using the VR controllers.
          The alternative is to use the standalone version and launch the game in Steam VR with Theater Mode. Not ideal.
