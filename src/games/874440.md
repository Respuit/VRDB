          The game runs well in all three - ALVR, Steam Link and WiVRn. Currently, when run via steam link, the bug of a temporary blackout when overlays and notifications appear still flares up occasionally, but Steam Link is currently in beta and the bug will likely be fixed when you're reading this.
          Gameplay here (with the blackout bug showing up at times): https://youtu.be/R8ysQzCwwBM
