          Set up screen gives option for tutorial or skip but clicking does nothing.
          Controllers are tracking, clicking the trigger switches between controllers.  But the game buttons do not react.  Can't get past the initial screen.
          Same behavior in both ALVR and WiVRn.

          Managed to get the game working flawlessly on laptop with nVidia dGPU with NixOS, using Quest 3 and the newest SteamVR beta.
          No graphical issues, controllers worked out of the box. Only quirks are due to SteamVR which, once the game is launched, shows black screen in the headset over game window. 
          Killing vrwebhelper process allows to play the game normally, and this is not specific to this particular title but an overall issue with SteamVR on Linux.
