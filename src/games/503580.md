          Starts up successfully, although the image of the loading screen superimposes over everything else in the environment, making it very hard, if not impossible to play. Latest official experimental and latest GE proton have both been tested with this, to no luck.
          GE 7-55 Boots the game, but does not pick up the headset with envision and gets stuck at the SLZ logo, while GE 8-32 fails to start it entirely.
