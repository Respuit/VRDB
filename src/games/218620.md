          For the VR aspect to work, you need to use the Windows version of the game (Via Proton), not the native Linux version.
          Without any mods, the game runs perfectly in VR! Able to load heists without issues.
          With mods, once you setup SuperBLT, all the mods just work.
          Was able to host and play with friends, just like on Windows.
          Even the new SteamVR Controller Offset feature works with the game.
          Only thing I didn't test is public matchmaking, so your milage may vary.
          All in all, runs flawlessly in VR.
