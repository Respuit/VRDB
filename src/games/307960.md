          Works out of the box, only issue is a micro stuttering when you move your head but only the cockpit stutters, the exterior runs smooth. So no big deal for me. 
          Tip: if you want to disable rendering your view in the monitor open the startup.cfg  file (/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/IL-2 Sturmovik Battle of Stalingrad/data/startup.cfg) and change "or_render_eye = 0" from 0 to 1 or 2. On Windows it changes from both eyes to left or right eye but on Linux it turns the screen to black
