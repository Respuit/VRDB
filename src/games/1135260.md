          Running through ALVR + SteamVR, experienced no issues. As stated on the game's store page, input from VR controllers is not supported (gamepad or flight stick only); however I noticed when briefly messing with the input settings that it _does_ detect buttons from the Quest controllers. The axes would still be bound to the gamepad, but further tinkering might get around that.
