          Works flawlessly.
          Tested both with an Index using SteamVR and Monado, and a Quest 2 with WiVRn.

          Works ootb with Steam VR (I'm still on legacy 1.29) and Monado. For Monado it needs steam launch option `OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 %command%` to fix reflections.
          For modding also `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b"` is needed as steam launch option. For me Beat Saber is set to Proton Experimental (currently 2025-03-20)

          Works perfectly out of the box with both ALVR and WiVRn, vanilla and modded
          I use Proton-GE RTSP for this game due to me playing a lot of maps with the cinema mod

          Works perfectly out of the box. Don't forget to use the `OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 %command%` launch option if you have a Valve Index on Monado, or else the reflections won't look right. But that's not a game thing, that's just a quirk of this headset.

          They all run very bad compared to their windows counterpart, the latency is unbearable.

          As of October 2025, Beat Saber seems to turn into a black void whenever an overlay app is open. The workaround is to switch to the legacy1.40.8 version using the beta selector.
          Tested using GE-Proton10-20

          ALVR worked just fine as it should with the exception of high latency sometimes, on the 9060xt. However, when it comes to Wivrn it starts, i can see graphics, however the ui and menus do not show in VR, while they do on the desktop. Currently i have not found a fix for this just yet other than using ALVR for it.
