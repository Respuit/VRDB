          runs okayish with some configuration. Apparently there's no vr option on the linux build of escape sim, so you have to force the use of proton, then go into launch options and append `-es_vr` before launching. Also, there appear to be a weird bug where it won't launch if you manually launch it from steam, you have to pick it in wivrn then disconnect and reconnect your headset, but that may just be a misunderstanding on my part.
