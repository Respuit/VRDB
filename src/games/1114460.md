          WiVRn - doesn't work; it starts in VR but after the Unity splash screen, continues on the screen and doesn't respond to controls.
          ALVR - works.
          Steam Link - works.
          I don't recommend this game! It's VERY BAD!
          Versions:
          ALVR v20.14.1 (not used in this video)
          Steam Link via SteamVR beta 2.13.6
          WiVRn 25.11.1-5-gffd5cf88 with xrizer (not used in this video)
          Mesa 25.2.6
          kernel 6.17.6-273-tkg-eevdf
          GE-Proton 10-20 (GE-Proton, which incorporates the microsoft foundation classes patches for media playing, is needed for the cellphone to show the screen and be interactable)
