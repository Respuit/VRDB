          Despite working perfectly on all three streaming software (WiVRn, ALVR and Steam Link), DCS world _also_ works with advanced features like skeletal hand tracking! However, the base airplane from the free edition does not have interactable knobs and switches, only some paid airplanes.
          Putting skeletal hand tracking to start working is quite annoying, though, not from Linux but from the headset. Some solutions didn't work to me, like clicking the two controllers together or looking at my palms. Only when I put the controllers down in the ground it started working.
