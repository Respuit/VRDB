          I was able to load into the mod after extracting it into the games folder(and extracting the nightly release). I used proton GE 10-17 with xrizer on wivrn.
          works amazingly! I was having a strange audio issue where things happening right in front of me sounded far away. I think it just requires some audio setting tweaking though.
