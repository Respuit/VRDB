          Extreme double vision without a fix, unplayable in that state. Easy fix is adding OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 to the launch options.

          Works out of the box, no configuration needed. Stable for multiple hours of gameplay.

          Works perfectly. I am using my HOTAS to control the game and fly.
          Will crash to desktop in random moments every not so often.

          Works pretty much out-of-the-box in SteamVR mode (once you get SteamVR itself working, anyhow - still some overlay bugs there plus skipping the HTC link box for the HDMI cable).
          AMD Radeon RX 7600 on Wayland
          Note I tend to run the GE Proton builds by default, but I have at least 20+ hours in VR in the past year.  Can choose to launch in SteamVR or flatscreen mode in Steam's launch options each time.

          Requires running with `OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1` to avoid double vision.

          Nothing special to say. Launched Elite Dangerous trought ALVR+SteamVR, and it just worked fine. The distro was Manjaro

          SteamVR works, but suffers from the usual latency on AMD GPUs, so it's pretty nausea-inducing.
          Monado works with `OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1` in the launch options to fix the offset eye angles. I had to use Proton 7.0-6 as the compatibility tool, otherwise launching the game while Monado was started causes an error message in the launcher: "This Frontier account does not own Elite Dangerous".  
          This may or may not be related to https://gitlab.com/znixian/OpenOVR/-/issues/416.
