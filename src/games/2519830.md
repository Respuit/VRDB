          Linux Native version is outdated and unmaintained, make sure to switch to forcing Proton. 
          With Proton 9 it worked fine, i didnt test anything else.
          Besides that, Mirrors seemed to be broken. Each eye getting a different image and causing really messed up visuals. Like double vision basically.  To fix add OXR_PARALLEL_VIEWS=1 to your launch options. This fixes mirrors. 
          After both those little fixes, everything worked nicely without a single issue so far.

          Running this on Wayland via Envision, works perfectly, including with RML and Monkeyloader mods
          I am using the Proton version with Proton GE-RTSP, the native Linux build is considered deprecated

          Monado seems to be a bit better than SteamVR, but the game is very unoptimised.
          Also use the windows version using proton, since the linux native version runs worse.

          Linux Native build exists, but is unmaintained - had to force Proton. Otherwise works perfectly fine for me.

          Tested with Wivrn Master built with Envision. Recommended Proton version is the latest [RTSP](https://github.com/SpookySkeletons/proton-ge-rtsp/releases) branch.

          Runs well under proton despite some Resonite specific performance bugs that affect both Windows and Linux. Vive wands (and some other controllers) aren't properly detected due to a stub function in OpenComposite but it isn't hard to fix and I am working on a fork of OC on gitlab that will be a PR soon.
          There is a native Linux build but it is deprecated and not supported with lots of bugs. The Developers have said they will come back to the Linux native build after performance and a new build system called Molecule. but that's a while off yet

          Runs well through WiVRn via Flatpak, just no desktop available on x11, I need to use a separate overlay for that feature.

          Working perfectly with Monado and xrizer, do note that it will crash on startup if using OpenComposite at this time
