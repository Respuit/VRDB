          Its native VR is non-functional, but it works great with the SubmersedVR mod both in WiVRn and ALVR. Take notice that there was a recent game update (2025) that broke the mod, but it was made functional again in a couple days. Gameplay here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4yjIQOetasE
          For launch options on Steam, use `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b"  -vrmode openvr`
