          This one is still not working on Linux due to the partially implemented API HolographicSpace in wine/proton: https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6533

          After going through proton bug report https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/6533 and building my own proton build for it at https://github.com/Patola/wine/releases/tag/protola-10.0 the game is finally working. It will take some months for these patches to get to proton though.
          The name of the game seems to be different on Steam now -- Desperate Vlad instead of Desperate: Vladivostok but it's Steam appid 1832070.
          So, if you use my build of proton, you should be able to run it with WiVRN, ALVR and Steam Link. Gameplay here: https://youtu.be/BIbOCNXJ0wU
