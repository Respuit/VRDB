          works 99% out of the box, including custom song support.
          only thing that didn't work was recentering the playspace, but I fear that is a setup-specific issue as that exists with other games in my library

          Works perfectly.  Custom songs great.  ALVR occasionally has latency/lag which can cause a miss.  Prefer WiVRn for rhythm games.

          Works OK on an RX 5600 XT at 30% of the Bigscreen Beyond's 2x2560x2560 resolution (using the Launch Option `OXR_VIEWPORT_SCALE_PERCENTAGE=30 %command%`), but is a bit pixellated. If I can get my hands on a 9070 XT I'll update this as and when.
          Can't get SteamVR to work on Fedora, so haven't tested under SteamVR.

          Everything works perfectly. This is one of my oldest games and it always performed admirably. Gameplay here: https://youtu.be/1tn6GPrYRBU
