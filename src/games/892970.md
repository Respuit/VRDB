          Severe performance issues with SteamVR/ALVR. Recommend using WiVRn or Monado.
          Linux native version does not support the mod, so the Windows version must be used. To force the Windows version, simply select a Proton version under Game Propertiesãƒ»Compatibility.
          Proton version used for testing: GE-Proton9-16
          Launch options (required to activate mod):
          `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="winhttp=n,b" %command%`
          When launching the game, select "Play Valheim" and not the Vulkan option!
          Mesa: 24.3.4
          Kernel: 6.13.3-gentoo-dist
          Use OpenComposite 1.0.1459 or later. Not tested with XRizer.
          (If the quick select wheel doesn't work, your OC version is too old.)

          Works perfectly. I mean, there is some jankiness to the mod, but it's the same as Windows.
          Previously I had an issue where the controls would turn to the wrong side. I don't know what caused it but completely erasing the game and reinstalling from scratch with the mod solved it.

          The mod is here: https://github.com/brandonmousseau/vhvr-mod
