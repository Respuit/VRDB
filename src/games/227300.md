          Need to opt-in to a beta and force the use of Proton to start the game in VR mode, but works without issues.

          VR itself is working fine with Euro Truck Simulator 2 using the Oculus branch. Other issues are the common issues related to the game itself, that's mostly VR performance is pretty bad if you are using big maps like Promods, and you will have to live the lower FPS and resolution

          In the game page, select properties, and select the following tabs:
          - General: launch options, use `%command% -openxr`
          - Compatibility: select the latest proton, at this time Proton 9.0-4. Do not let if be the default otherwise it will try to run the linux binary that doesn't support VR.
          - Betas: choose the latest Oculus+OpenVR+OpenXR branch
          After that, start WiVRn, connect the headset and just press play. It should start in VR. There's no support to the touch controllers, so you have to use mouse and keyboard or joystick/wheel/whatever.
          Note: years ago the launch options were `%command% -openvr` but that changed.

          Switch to the openvr/oculus/openxr branch. And add `-openvr` to the launch options. The game runs pretty well with it and without any 3D issues like some older oculus games.
